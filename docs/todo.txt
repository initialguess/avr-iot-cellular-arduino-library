- Add URC registration callbacks
    - Have interrupt on RING?
    - And register callbacks for functions?
- There is some race condition with hal_i2c where the if we don't use enough time, it just halts. Need the delay for now
- Some hostnames still doesn't work...
- Remove functions which won't be used.
- Document mqtt
- Strings in progmem?
- Lights for seeing that one is connected/sending data
    - Make status LED blink when we're trying to connect?

**For Spence:**
- Want to use Serial from core for AT command interface, but need more control of interrupts for RXE due to "semaphore" lines used for flow control. Would be nice or we have to roll with our own solution.
- Need extra flag for linking towards libcryptoauth.a, set as compiler.extra_archive_paths for the moment
- Rewrite TwoWire::write(const uint8_t* data, size_t quantity) to check error.
- Need to specify "utility/" infront of twi.h and twi_pins.h
- Need to define the different variants of pinswap for i2c somewhere. If not the pinswap for Wire fails.
